Literal string:
  Characters enclosed in double-quote characters. They can use escape characters like \t for tab. To represent a backslash, use two: \\.
Verbatim string:
  A literal string prefixed with @ to disable escape characters so that a backslash is a backslash. It also allows the string value to span multiple lines because the white space characters are treated as themselves instead of instructions to the compiler.

Interpolated string:
  A literal string prefixed with $ to enable embedded formatted variables. You will learn more about this later in this chapter.

Good Practice:
  Never compare double values using ==.
  During the First Gulf War, an American Patriot missile battery used double values in its calculations. The inaccuracy caused it to fail to track and intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missile, and 28 soldiers were killed; you can read about this at https://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/patriot.html.

Good Practice:
  Use int for whole numbers.
  Use double for real numbers that will not be compared for equality to other values; it is okay to compare double values being less than or greater than, and so on.
  Use decimal for money, CAD drawings, general engineering, and wherever the accuracy of a real number is important.

Numbers
  L: infers long
  UL: infers ulong
  M: infers decimal
  D: infers double
